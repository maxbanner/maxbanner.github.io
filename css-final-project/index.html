Milwauke is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin. Milwaukee is also the fifth-largest city in the Midwestern United States, only surpasses by cities such as Chicago and Detroit. Milwaukee is home to the Bucks, the state's basketballs team. The Brewers, the state's baseball team, and the Admirals, the state's hockey team, also call Milwaukee their home. Milwaukee offers many locally brewed beers. This is due to its German Ancestry and high numbers of German immigrants in the 1840's. 
Located in the Great Lakes region, just off of Lake Michigan, Milwaukee suffers from what the locals call "The Lake Effect." The Lake Effect causes temperatures to change slower in Milwaukee than more western cities in the state. For example; cooling happens during the day from April to October causing cooler temperatures in the summer.
