    Our first stop was Mercury, an <em>inner planet</em>, meaning that it is one of the first planets inside the asteroid belt. We landed and saw the beautiful monochrome landscape. Truely it was beautiful and inspiring! I never knew that black and white could be so appealing. Eventually we sat down and had lunch and struggled with the lower gravity. The low-grav made it really hard to eat my PB&amp;J. Soon after we had to return to the spaceship because we were running out of oxygen.

    Our second stop was Venus. We got lost along the way because we forgot to pack some sort of navigational device. I would recommend something of the sort for anyone else who would attempt this trip. It was very hot and the ground was orange and dusty. We didn't stay for very long but we throughly enjoyed our time watching the sun rise in the west and set in the east due to how the planet rotates.

    Earth is very beautiful! Before we landed we stopped on the moon, earth's <em>satellite</em>. A <em>satellite</em> is a body or object, in this case; the moon, that orbits around a planet. Upon our approad to earth, the planetary atmosphere was one of the best I've ever seen. Planetary is used to describe the characteristics of a planet. Earth was my favorite planet, I loved it so much I made a top 10 list of everything I enjoyed about it!
