<p id="p1">NASCAR Heat is a 2000 racing video game for the PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color. It was developed by Monster Games and published by Hasbro Interactive. The PlayStation version was co-developed with Digital Illusions CE.[1]
Reception
The PC version of the game was well-received as IGN.com stated, "MGI aims an uppercut at Papyrus' NASCAR throne and connects, doing serious damage!" They awarded the game a score of 9.0 (Amazing).[2] The PS version did well enough, but not as well as the PC version scoring an 8.0 (Great). For the PS version, IGN.com said, "This surprisingly good racing game packs quite a bit of punch in terms of play modes and crazy fun."[3]
GameSpot stated for the PC version, "NASCAR Heat offers a brutally honest driving experience, but with simplistic damage modeling." It received a score of 7.5 (Good).[4] For the GBC version, "If you've ever wondered what Micro Machines would be like with NASCAR drivers, Majesco's NASCAR Heat is the answer. This version score a 6.8 (Fair).[5] Finally, the PS iteration of the game didn't fare too well, as they stated, "NASCAR Heat isn't quite the all-encompassing racing simulation that Electronic Arts' NASCAR 2001 is, but features like the beat the heat mode make the game worthwhile for any NASCAR fan. PS version scored 5.2 (Mediocre).[6]
